/**
 * Problem: Fibonacci Number
 * 
 * The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, 
 * such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
