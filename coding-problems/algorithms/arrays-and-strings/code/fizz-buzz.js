/**
 * Problem: FizzBuzz
 * 
 * Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n.
 * But for multiples of three it should output "Fizz" instead of the number and 
 * for the multiples of five output "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of 
 * both three and five output "FizzBuzz".
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: n = 15
 * Output: ["1","2","Fizz","4","Buzz","Fizz","7","8","Fizz","Buzz","11","Fizz","13","14","FizzBuzz"]
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n) for output array
