/**
 * Problem: Richest Customer Wealth
 * 
 * You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money 
 * the ith customer has in the jth bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.
 * A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: 1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, 2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(m * n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
