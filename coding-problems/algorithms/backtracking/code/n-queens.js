/**
 * Problem: N-Queens
 * 
 * The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard
 * such that no two queens attack each other.
 * 
 * Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
 * You may return the answer in any order.
 * 
 * Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement,
 * where 'Q' and '.' indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: n = 4
 * Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
 * Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n!)
 * Space Complexity: O(n^2)
