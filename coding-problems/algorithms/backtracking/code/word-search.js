/**
 * Problem: Word Search
 * 
 * Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.
 * 
 * The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells,
 * where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring.
 * The same letter cell may not be used more than once.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
 * Output: true
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
 * Output: true
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(N * 4^L) where N is number of cells, L is word length
 * Space Complexity: O(L)
