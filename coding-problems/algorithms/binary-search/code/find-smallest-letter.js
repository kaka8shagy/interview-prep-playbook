/**
 * Problem: Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target
 * 
 * Given a characters array letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order and a character target, 
 * return the smallest character in the array that is larger than target.
 * Note that the letters wrap around.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
 * Output: "c"
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(log n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
