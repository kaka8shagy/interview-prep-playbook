/**
 * Problem: Single Element in a Sorted Array
 * 
 * You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, 
 * except for one element which appears exactly once.
 * Return the single element that appears only once.
 * Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(log n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
