/**
 * Problem: Coin Change II
 * 
 * You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount 
 * representing a total amount of money. Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. 
 * If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: amount = 5, coins = [1,2,5]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
 * 5=5, 5=2+2+1, 5=2+1+1+1, 5=1+1+1+1+1
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(amount * coins.length)
 * Space Complexity: O(amount)
