/**
 * Problem: Fibonacci Number
 * 
 * The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence,
 * such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: n = 4
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
