/**
 * Problem: Longest Increasing Subsequence
 * 
 * Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
 * 
 * A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements
 * without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 * For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: nums = [10,22,9,33,21,50,41,60]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [10,22,33,50,60], therefore the length is 5.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n^2) for DP, O(n log n) for binary search approach
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
