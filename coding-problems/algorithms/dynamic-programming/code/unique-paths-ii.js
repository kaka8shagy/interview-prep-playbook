/**
 * Problem: Unique Paths II
 * 
 * You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). 
 * The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
 * An obstacle and space are marked as 1 and 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.
 * Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
 * There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
 * 1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
 * 2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(m * n)
 * Space Complexity: O(m * n)
