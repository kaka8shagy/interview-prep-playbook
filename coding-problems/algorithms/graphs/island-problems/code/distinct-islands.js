/**
 * Problem: Number of Distinct Islands
 * 
 * You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land)
 * connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
 * 
 * Two islands are considered the same if and only if one island can be translated (and not rotated or reflected)
 * to equal the other.
 * 
 * Return the number of distinct islands.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: grid = [[1,1,0,0,0],
 *                [1,1,0,0,0],
 *                [0,0,0,1,1],
 *                [0,0,0,1,1]]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(m * n)
 * Space Complexity: O(m * n)
