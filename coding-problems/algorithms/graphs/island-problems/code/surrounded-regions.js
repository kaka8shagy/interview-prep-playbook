/**
 * Problem: Surrounded Regions
 * 
 * Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.
 * A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
 * Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
 * Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
 * - It is on the border, or
 * - It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
 * The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(m * n)
 * Space Complexity: O(m * n)
