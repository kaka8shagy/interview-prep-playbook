/**
 * Problem: Sequence Reconstruction
 * 
 * Check whether the original sequence org can be uniquely reconstructed from the sequences in seqs.
 * The org sequence is a permutation of the integers from 1 to n, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
 * 
 * Reconstruction means building a shortest common supersequence of the sequences in seqs
 * (i.e., a shortest sequence so that all sequences in seqs are subsequences of it).
 * 
 * Determine whether there is only one sequence that can be reconstructed from seqs and it is the org sequence.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: org = [1,2,3], seqs = [[1,2],[1,3]]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: [1,2,3] is not the only one sequence that can be reconstructed
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(V + E)
 * Space Complexity: O(V + E)
