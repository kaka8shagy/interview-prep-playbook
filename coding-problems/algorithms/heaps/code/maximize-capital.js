/**
 * Problem: IPO (Maximize Capital)
 * 
 * Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital,
 * LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO.
 * 
 * Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO.
 * Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k distinct projects.
 * 
 * You are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital of capital[i] is needed to start it.
 * 
 * Initially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.
 * 
 * Pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital, and return the final maximized capital.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.
 * After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.
 * With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.
 * Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish projects 0 and 2 to get the maximum capital.
 * Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n log n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
