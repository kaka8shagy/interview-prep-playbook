/**
 * Problem: Sliding Window Median
 * 
 * The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, 
 * there is no middle value so the median is the mean of the two middle values.
 * You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. There is a sliding window of size k 
 * which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. 
 * Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.
 * Return the median array for each window in the original array.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
 * Output: [1.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000,3.00000,5.00000,6.00000]
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n log k)
 * Space Complexity: O(k)
