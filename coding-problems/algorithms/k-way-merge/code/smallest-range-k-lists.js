/**
 * Problem: Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists
 * 
 * You have k lists of sorted integers in non-decreasing order.
 * Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists.
 * 
 * We define the range [a, b] is smaller than range [c, d] if b - a < d - c or a < c if b - a == d - c.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: nums = [[4,10,15,24,26],[0,9,12,20],[5,18,22,30]]
 * Output: [20,24]
 * Explanation: 
 * List 1: [4, 10, 15, 24,26], 24 is in range [20,24].
 * List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20], 20 is in range [20,24].
 * List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30], 22 is in range [20,24].
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n * log k) where n is total elements
 * Space Complexity: O(k)
