/**
 * Problem: Linked List Cycle
 * 
 * Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again 
 * by continuously following the next pointer.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
