/**
 * Problem: Interval List Intersections
 * 
 * You are given two lists of closed intervals, firstList and secondList, where firstList[i] = [starti, endi]
 * and secondList[j] = [startj, endj]. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.
 * 
 * Return the intersection of these two interval lists.
 * 
 * A closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.
 * 
 * The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are in both intervals.
 * For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
 * Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(m + n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
