/**
 * Problem: Meeting Rooms
 * 
 * Given an array of meeting time intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], 
 * determine if a person could attend all meetings.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: [0,30] and [5,10] overlap, [0,30] and [15,20] overlap.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n log n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
