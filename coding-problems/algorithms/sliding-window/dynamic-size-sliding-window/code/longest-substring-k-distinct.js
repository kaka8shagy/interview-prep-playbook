/**
 * Problem: Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters
 * 
 * Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s 
 * that contains at most k distinct characters.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The substring is "ece" with length 3.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(k)
