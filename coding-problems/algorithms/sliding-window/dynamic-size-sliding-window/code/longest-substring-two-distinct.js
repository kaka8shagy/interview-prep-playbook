/**
 * Problem: Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters
 * 
 * Given a string s, return the length of the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: s = "eceba"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The substring is "ece" which its length is 3.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
