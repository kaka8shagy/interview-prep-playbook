/**
 * Problem: Max Consecutive Ones
 * 
 * Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
 * The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
