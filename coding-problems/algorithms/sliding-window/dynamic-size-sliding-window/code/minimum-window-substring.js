/**
 * Problem: Minimum Window Substring
 * 
 * Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s 
 * such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. 
 * If there is no such window, return the empty string "".
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
 * Output: "BANC"
 * Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(m + n)
 * Space Complexity: O(m + n)
