/**
 * Problem: Find All Anagrams in a String
 * 
 * Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s.
 * You may return the answer in any order.
 * An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, 
 * typically using all the original letters exactly once.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
 * Output: [0,2]
 * Explanation: The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
 * The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
