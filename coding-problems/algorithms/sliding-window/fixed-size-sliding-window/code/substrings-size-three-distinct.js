/**
 * Problem: Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters
 * 
 * A string is good if there are no repeated characters.
 * Given a string s​​​​​, return the number of good substrings of length three in s​​​​​​.
 * Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: s = "xyzzaz"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: There are 4 substrings of size 3: "xyz", "yzz", "zza", "zaz". 
 * The only good substring of length 3 is "xyz".
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
