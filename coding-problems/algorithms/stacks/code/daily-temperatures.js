/**
 * Problem: Daily Temperatures
 * 
 * Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer 
 * such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. 
 * If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
 * Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
