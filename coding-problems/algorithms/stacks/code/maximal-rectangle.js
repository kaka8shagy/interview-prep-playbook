/**
 * Problem: Maximal Rectangle
 * 
 * Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(rows * cols)
 * Space Complexity: O(cols)
