/**
 * Problem: Sort Array by Increasing Frequency
 * 
 * Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in increasing order based on the frequency of the values. 
 * If multiple values have the same frequency, sort them in decreasing order.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
 * Output: [3,1,1,2,2,2]
 * Explanation: '3' has a frequency of 1, '1' has a frequency of 2, and '2' has a frequency of 3.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n log n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
