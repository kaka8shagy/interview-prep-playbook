/**
 * Problem: Sort Characters By Frequency
 * 
 * Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. 
 * The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: s = "tree"
 * Output: "eert"
 * Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
 * So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n log n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
