/**
 * Problem: Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree
 * 
 * Given the root of a binary tree, calculate the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.
 * 
 * For each node at position (row, col), its left and right children will be at positions
 * (row + 1, col - 1) and (row + 1, col + 1) respectively.
 * The root of the tree is at (0, 0).
 * 
 * The vertical order traversal of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index
 * starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column.
 * There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.
 * 
 * Return the vertical order traversal of the binary tree.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
 * Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n log n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
