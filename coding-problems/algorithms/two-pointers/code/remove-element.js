/**
 * Problem: Remove Element
 * 
 * Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. 
 * The relative order of the elements may be changed.
 * Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead 
 * have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. 
 * More formally, if there are k elements after removing the occurrences of val, then the first k elements 
 * of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.
 * Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
 * Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
