/**
 * Problem: Sort Colors
 * 
 * Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects 
 * of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
 * We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
 * You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
 * Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
