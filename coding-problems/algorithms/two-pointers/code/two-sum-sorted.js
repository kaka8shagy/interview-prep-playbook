/**
 * Problem: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
 * 
 * Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order,
 * find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
 * Output: [1,2]
 * Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
