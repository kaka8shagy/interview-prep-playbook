/**
 * Problem: Satisfiability of Equality Equations
 * 
 * You are given an array of strings equations that represent relationships between variables
 * where each string equations[i] is of length 4 and takes one of two different forms:
 * "xi==yi" or "xi!=yi". Here, xi and yi are lowercase letters (not necessarily different)
 * that represent one-letter variable names.
 * 
 * Return true if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations,
 * or false otherwise.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: equations = ["a==b","b!=a"]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.
 * There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n * Î±(n))
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - only 26 letters
