### React Performance (Extend)
- [ ] **Virtual Scrolling Implementation** - Large list rendering, viewport optimization, dynamic sizing
- [ ] **Memory Leak Detector** - Event listener cleanup, reference monitoring, garbage collection helpers

### Network (Extend)
- [ ] **Request Deduplication** - Prevent duplicate API calls, intelligent caching, request merging
- [ ] **Network Status Manager** - Offline detection, connection quality monitoring, adaptive loading

### DOM Utilities (Extend) 
- [ ] **Focus Management System** - Tab trapping, focus restoration, keyboard navigation, ARIA integration
- [ ] **Tooltip Positioning Engine** - Smart positioning, collision detection, responsive positioning

## ðŸŽ¨ Phase 3: Specialized Features (LOW PRIORITY)
*Timeline: 1-2 weeks | Problems: 4-6*

### UI Patterns (New Category)
- [ ] **Drag & Drop Framework** - Multi-touch support, constraints, visual feedback, accessibility
- [ ] **Modal Manager** - Stack management, backdrop handling, escape key support, focus management

### Animation (New Category)
- [ ] **Easing Functions Library** - Custom timing functions, spring physics, bezier curves
- [ ] **Animation Timeline Manager** - Sequence orchestration, playback control, performance optimization

### Testing (New Category)
- [ ] **Mock Service Worker** - API mocking, request interception, response simulation
- [ ] **Component Testing Utilities** - Render helpers, user interaction simulation, assertion helpers

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Guidelines

### Each Problem Should Include:
- **3-4 Implementation Approaches** (Basic â†’ Optimized â†’ Production â†’ Advanced)
- **Extensive Comments** (30-50% of code explaining "why" and "how")
- **Real-world Use Cases** with practical examples
- **Performance Analysis** (time/space complexity, optimization strategies)
- **Interview Focus Points** (common gotchas, follow-up questions)
- **Company Relevance** (FAANG vs startup vs product company patterns)
- **Browser Compatibility** considerations and polyfill strategies

### Quality Standards:
- âœ… Multiple solution approaches with trade-off analysis
- âœ… Comment-heavy code with mental model explanations  
- âœ… Edge case handling and error scenarios
- âœ… Performance benchmarking and optimization techniques
- âœ… Production-ready patterns with cleanup and memory management
- âœ… Interview-style problem progression (requirements â†’ clarification â†’ implementation)

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Outcomes

### Coverage Expansion:
- **Security**: 90% of frontend security interview questions
- **Modern APIs**: 95% of browser API implementation challenges  
- **State Management**: Complete spectrum from basic to advanced patterns
- **Performance**: Comprehensive optimization techniques and monitoring
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance and assistive technology support

### Interview Readiness:
- **FAANG**: Advanced patterns, system design thinking, optimization focus
- **Product Companies**: User experience, practical applications, real-world scenarios
- **Startups**: Quick implementation, fundamental patterns, adaptability

### Documentation Updates Required:
- [ ] Update README.md navigation and problem count
- [ ] Refresh problems-by-category.md with new categories
- [ ] Update difficulty-guide.md progression paths
- [ ] Enhance company-guide.md with new problem mappings  
- [ ] Expand quick-reference.md frequency ratings
