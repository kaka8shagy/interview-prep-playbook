## Interview Focus Areas

### For Staff/Architect Roles

1. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Micro-frontends vs Monolithic
   - Build tool selection (Webpack vs Vite vs Turbopack)
   - Framework selection criteria
   - Design system implementation

2. **Performance at Scale**
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Runtime performance profiling
   - Memory leak detection
   - Network optimization

3. **Advanced Patterns**
   - Render optimization strategies
   - State normalization
   - Real-time synchronization
   - Offline-first architecture

## Common Interview Questions

### System Design
- Design a real-time collaborative editor
- Design a video streaming platform frontend
- Design a social media feed with infinite scroll
- Design a dashboard with complex data visualizations

### Coding Challenges
- Implement virtual scrolling
- Build a custom hook for data fetching
- Create a debounce/throttle utility
- Implement promise.all from scratch

### Architecture Discussion
- How would you migrate from CRA to Next.js?
- Explain your approach to implement micro-frontends
- How do you handle authentication across multiple apps?
- Design a caching strategy for a large e-commerce site
