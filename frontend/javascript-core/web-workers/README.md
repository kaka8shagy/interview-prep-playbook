# JavaScript Web Workers

## Quick Summary
- Web Workers run JavaScript in background threads
- Enable parallel execution without blocking main thread
- Communicate via message passing (postMessage)
- No direct access to DOM or main thread variables
- Types: Dedicated, Shared, Service Workers

## Core Concepts

### What are Web Workers?
Scripts that run in background threads, separate from main UI thread. Enable concurrent execution for CPU-intensive tasks.

Basic usage: `./code/worker-basics.js`

### Worker Types
1. **Dedicated Workers**: Private to creating script
2. **Shared Workers**: Shared between multiple scripts
3. **Service Workers**: Act as proxy between web app and network

Types overview: `./code/worker-types.js`

### Message Passing
Workers communicate with main thread through structured cloning.

Communication: `./code/message-passing.js`

## Dedicated Workers

### Creating Workers
Basic worker creation and lifecycle.
Example: `./code/dedicated-worker.js`

### Worker Script
What goes inside a worker script.
Example: `./code/worker-script.js`

### Error Handling
Managing worker errors and exceptions.
Example: `./code/worker-errors.js`

### Terminating Workers
Properly shutting down workers.
Example: `./code/worker-termination.js`

## Advanced Features

### Shared Array Buffer
Sharing memory between threads (experimental).
Example: `./code/shared-array-buffer.js`

### Transferable Objects
Transfer ownership instead of copying.
Example: `./code/transferable-objects.js`

### Worker Pools
Managing multiple workers efficiently.
Implementation: `./code/worker-pools.js`

### Dynamic Worker Creation
Creating workers from strings.
Example: `./code/dynamic-workers.js`

### Background Sync
Periodic background operations.
Implementation: `./code/background-sync.js`

### WebSocket Handling
Network operations in workers.
Implementation: `./code/websocket-worker.js`

## Shared Workers

### Creating Shared Workers
Workers shared between tabs/windows.
Example: `./code/shared-workers.js`

### Port Communication
Message ports for shared worker communication.
Example: `./code/port-communication.js`

### Cross-Tab Communication
Communication between browser tabs.
Implementation: `./code/cross-tab.js`

## Service Workers

### Basic Service Worker
Intercepting network requests.
Example: `./code/service-worker-basics.js`

### Caching Strategies
Offline functionality implementation.
Example: `./code/caching-strategies.js`

### Background Sync
Syncing when connection restored.
Example: `./code/service-worker-sync.js`

Techniques: `./code/debugging-workers.js`

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Blocking Operations
Long-running tasks blocking worker.
Solution: `./code/pitfall-blocking.js`

### Pitfall 2: Memory Leaks
Unreleased worker references.
Solution: `./code/pitfall-memory.js`

### Pitfall 3: Serialization Cost
Expensive data transfer.
Solution: `./code/pitfall-serialization.js`

### Pitfall 4: Error Propagation
Unhandled worker errors.
Solution: `./code/pitfall-errors.js`

## Modern APIs

### Worker Modules
ES6 modules in workers.
Example: `./code/worker-modules.js`

### OffscreenCanvas

Implementation: `./code/stream-processing.js`

## Testing Workers

### Unit Testing
Testing worker functionality.
Framework: `./code/worker-testing.js`

### Mocking Workers
Simulating workers in tests.

## Best Practices

### DO:
- Use for CPU-intensive tasks
- Implement proper error handling
- Clean up workers when done
- Use transferable objects for large data
- Keep worker scripts simple and focused

### DON'T:
- Create too many workers
- Use for simple operations
- Forget to terminate workers
- Share complex objects
- Rely on worker availability
