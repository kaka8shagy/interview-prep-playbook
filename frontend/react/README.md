## Interview Preparation Path

### For L5/L6 (Senior/Staff)
1. **Must Know**: Fundamentals, Hooks, Performance basics
2. **Should Know**: State management, Component patterns
3. **Good to Know**: Testing, Architecture patterns

### For L7 (Principal/Architect)
- All above topics with deep understanding
- Framework comparison and trade-offs
- Performance at scale
- Architecture decision making
- Team patterns and best practices

## Common Interview Patterns

### Concept Questions
- "Explain React reconciliation"
- "What is the virtual DOM?"
- "How do hooks work internally?"

### Code Challenges
- Build reusable components
- Implement custom hooks
- Optimize performance bottlenecks
- Design component APIs

### Architecture Questions
- "How would you structure a large React app?"
- "State management strategy for complex apps"
- "React vs other frameworks trade-offs"

### Debugging Scenarios
- Fix performance issues
- Resolve state update bugs
- Handle async data loading
- Manage component lifecycle issues

## Study Tips

### Hands-On Practice
1. Build projects using different patterns
2. Profile and optimize real applications
3. Create custom hook libraries
4. Implement complex state flows

### Framework Knowledge
1. Understand React internals (Fiber, reconciliation)
2. Know ecosystem libraries and their trade-offs
3. Stay current with React updates and RFCs
4. Practice with development tools

### Interview Preparation
1. Build portfolio projects showcasing skills
2. Practice explaining concepts clearly
3. Prepare for live coding challenges
4. Know common pitfalls and solutions

## Next Steps
- Complete all React topics with hands-on examples
- Build projects combining multiple concepts  
- Practice system design with React architecture
- Review framework internals and source code
