# React Hooks

## Quick Summary
- Hooks let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components
- Follow rules of hooks: only call at top level, only in React functions
- Built-in hooks cover most common use cases
- Custom hooks enable reusable stateful logic
- Hooks replaced class components as the preferred pattern

## Core Hooks

## Best Practices

### DO:
- Follow rules of hooks consistently
- Use ESLint plugin for hooks
- Keep effects focused and clean
- Clean up subscriptions and timers
- Use correct dependency arrays

### DON'T:
- Call hooks conditionally
- Call hooks in loops or nested functions
- Forget to clean up effects
- Ignore ESLint warnings
- Over-optimize with useMemo/useCallback

## Hook Composition Strategies

## Common Interview Mistakes

### Conceptual Errors
- Not understanding hook closure behavior
- Missing dependency array implications
- Confusing useLayoutEffect vs useEffect
- Not knowing hook execution order

### Implementation Errors
- Calling hooks conditionally
- Incorrect cleanup functions
- Missing dependencies in arrays
- Creating infinite loops

### Performance Issues
- Overusing useMemo/useCallback
- Creating new objects in render
- Not memoizing expensive calculations
- Causing unnecessary re-renders

## Practice Problems

1. Build useWindowSize hook
2. Create useInterval hook with cleanup
3. Implement useUndoRedo for state management
4. Build useKeyPress for keyboard handling
5. Create useAsync for promise management
