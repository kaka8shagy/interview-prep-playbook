## Best Practices

### DO:
- Use composition over inheritance
- Keep HOCs pure and focused
- Implement proper displayName for debugging
- Use TypeScript for pattern type safety
- Consider performance implications

### DON'T:
- Overuse HOCs for simple logic
- Create deeply nested render props
- Forget to forward refs in HOCs
- Ignore static hoisting
- Mix multiple patterns unnecessarily

## Testing Patterns
