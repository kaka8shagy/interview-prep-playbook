# React Performance

## Quick Summary
- React performance is about minimizing unnecessary re-renders
- Use React.memo, useMemo, useCallback for optimization

## Best Practices

### DO:

- Use React DevTools Profiler
- Memoize expensive calculations
- Split code at route boundaries
- Keep components focused and small

### DON'T:
- Over-optimize without measuring
- Use inline objects/functions in JSX
- Create new functions on every render
- Forget to clean up effects
- Put everything in useMemo/useCallback
