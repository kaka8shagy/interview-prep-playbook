# React Router Implementation

## Quick Summary
- Declarative routing enables component-based navigation in React SPAs
- Route composition allows nested routing patterns for complex applications
- Navigation management includes programmatic and declarative approaches
- Performance considerations involve code splitting and route optimization
- Authentication patterns integrate route guards with state management

## Core Concepts

### Declarative Routing Philosophy
React Router follows React's declarative paradigm, treating routes as components rather than imperative configuration. This approach enables:
- Component-based route definitions that integrate naturally with React trees
- Dynamic route composition based on application state
- Predictable navigation behavior through consistent API patterns

### Route Matching Strategy
React Router uses path-to-regexp for route matching, supporting:
- Static routes for exact path matching
- Dynamic segments using colon syntax (`:id`)
- Optional parameters with question mark syntax (`:id?`)
- Wildcard matching with asterisk syntax (`*`)
- Route ranking algorithm that prioritizes specific over general paths

### Browser History Management
Router implementations handle browser history through different strategies:
- Browser Router uses HTML5 history API for clean URLs
- Hash Router uses URL hash for compatibility with older browsers
- Memory Router maintains history in memory for testing environments
- Each strategy affects SEO, bookmarking, and server configuration requirements

## Implementation Patterns

### Basic Routing Architecture
See implementation: `./code/basic-routing.jsx`

The foundation involves wrapping your application with a Router provider and defining route components. Key considerations include:
- Router placement at application root for context propagation
- Route organization follows component hierarchy patterns
- Default route handling for unmatched paths

### Nested Routing Patterns
See implementation: `./code/nested-routes.jsx`

Complex applications require hierarchical routing structures that mirror UI component nesting:
- Parent routes define layout components with `<Outlet>` placeholders
- Child routes render within parent outlet components
- Route inheritance allows parameter and context sharing across levels
- Index routes provide default content when parent paths match exactly

### Authentication Integration
See implementation: `./code/route-guards.jsx`

Route protection patterns integrate authentication state with navigation:
- Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login
- Role-based access control filters routes by user permissions
- Authentication context provides user state across route components
- Redirect handling preserves intended destination after login

### Dynamic Route Management
See implementation: `./code/dynamic-routes.jsx`

Applications often require runtime route generation based on data:
- Parameter-based routes handle entity-specific pages
- Query parameter management for filtering and search
- Route generation from API responses or configuration
- Conditional route rendering based on feature flags

## Navigation Strategies

### Programmatic Navigation
React Router provides hooks for imperative navigation:
- `useNavigate` hook enables navigation from event handlers
- Navigation options include replacement vs push to history stack
- State passing allows data transfer between routes without URL exposure
- Relative navigation supports component portability across route hierarchies

### Declarative Navigation
Link components handle most navigation scenarios:
- NavLink provides active state styling for navigation menus
- Link component prevents full page reloads in SPA context
- External link handling requires different approaches
- Link prefetching can improve perceived performance

### Navigation Guards
Route transition control prevents navigation under certain conditions:
- Unsaved form changes can block navigation with confirmation
- Authentication requirements redirect to login before proceeding
- Loading states prevent navigation during critical operations
- Error boundaries handle navigation failures gracefully

## Performance Optimization

### Code Splitting Strategies
Route-level code splitting provides natural application boundaries:
- Lazy loading reduces initial bundle size
- Route preloading improves navigation perceived performance
- Component-level splitting within routes enables granular optimization
- Bundle analysis helps identify splitting opportunities

### Route Preloading
Anticipatory loading improves user experience:
- Hover-based preloading for predictable navigation patterns
- Route data prefetching reduces loading states
- Background route preparation during idle periods
- Smart preloading based on user behavior patterns

### Memory Management
Single page applications require careful memory management:
- Component cleanup on route changes prevents memory leaks
- Event listener removal in useEffect cleanup functions
- Route data caching balances performance with memory usage
- Navigation history limits prevent unbounded memory growth

## Common Pitfalls

### Route Definition Order
Route matching follows definition order, causing common issues:
- Specific routes must appear before general wildcard routes
- Dynamic segments can mask static routes if placed incorrectly
- Route ranking algorithm may not match developer expectations
- Testing route precedence prevents production navigation bugs

### State Management Integration
Router state integration with application state requires careful consideration:
- URL synchronization with application state prevents inconsistencies
- Route parameter changes should trigger component updates appropriately
- Navigation timing relative to state updates affects user experience
- Server-side rendering requires isomorphic routing approaches

### Browser Compatibility
Different routing strategies have varying browser support requirements:
- HTML5 history API requires modern browsers and server configuration
- Hash routing works universally but affects URL aesthetics
- Server configuration must handle client-side routing for refresh scenarios
- Fallback strategies ensure graceful degradation

## Interview Questions
