# Reliability & Availability

## Quick Summary
- Fault tolerance enables systems to continue operating despite component failures
- Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures by isolating faulty services
- Redundancy strategies eliminate single points of failure through replication
- Disaster recovery ensures business continuity during major outages
- SLA/SLO metrics define and measure system reliability targets

## Core Concepts

### Fault Tolerance Fundamentals

**Failure vs Fault vs Error**
- **Fault**: Underlying defect or imperfection (hardware failure, software bug)
- **Error**: Manifestation of a fault within the system state
- **Failure**: System deviating from its specified behavior due to errors

**Fault Tolerance Strategies**
- **Fail-fast**: Detect failures quickly and stop processing immediately
- **Fail-safe**: Continue operating in a degraded but safe mode
- **Fail-silent**: Stop responding rather than providing incorrect results
- **Fail-operational**: Continue normal operation despite faults

### Reliability Patterns

**Circuit Breaker Pattern**
- Monitors service health and prevents calls to failing services
- Three states: Closed (normal), Open (failing), Half-Open (testing recovery)
- Prevents cascade failures and reduces response time during outages

**Bulkhead Pattern**
- Isolates system resources to prevent total system failure
- Based on ship design: compartments prevent entire ship from sinking
- Examples: separate thread pools, connection pools, circuit breakers per service

**Timeout and Retry Patterns**
- Set maximum wait times to prevent hanging requests
- Implement exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming recovering services
- Use jitter to prevent thundering herd problems

### Redundancy and Replication

**Active-Active Configuration**
- Multiple instances handle traffic simultaneously
- Load is distributed across all instances
- Higher resource utilization but complex state synchronization

**Active-Passive Configuration**
- One primary instance handles traffic, others standby
- Faster failover but lower resource utilization
- Simpler state management and consistency

**Geographic Redundancy**
- Deploy across multiple data centers or regions
- Protects against regional disasters and network partitions
- Balances availability with latency and consistency trade-offs

### Multi-Tier Reliability
- Web tier: Load balancers with health checks
- Application tier: Circuit breakers and bulkheads
- Data tier: Replication and backup strategies
- Network tier: Redundant connections and failover

### Microservices Reliability
- Service mesh for inter-service communication
- Distributed circuit breakers and timeouts
- Graceful degradation of non-critical services
- Observability and monitoring across service boundaries

### Data Reliability
- Database replication (master-slave, master-master)
- Backup strategies (full, incremental, differential)
- Cross-region data synchronization
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities

## Common Pitfalls

### Design Anti-Patterns
- **Cascading failures**: Single service failure bringing down entire system
- **Shared fate**: Multiple services depending on same single point of failure
- **Timeouts too long**: Slow failure detection leading to resource exhaustion
- **No circuit breaker**: Continuously calling failed services
- **Synchronous communication**: Blocking calls creating dependency chains

### Monitoring Blind Spots
- **False positives**: Health checks that don't reflect real service health
- **Late detection**: Monitoring systems that detect failures too slowly
- **Alert fatigue**: Too many non-actionable alerts reducing response effectiveness
- **Missing metrics**: Not monitoring critical business metrics

### Recovery Issues
- **Split-brain**: Multiple instances thinking they are primary
- **Data inconsistency**: Failover causing data corruption or loss
- **Capacity planning**: Insufficient capacity after failover
- **Testing failures**: Disaster recovery procedures not regularly tested

## Reliability Metrics

### Availability Calculations

- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss

### Error Budgets
- **Error Budget**: Allowed downtime based on SLA (e.g., 99.9% = 43.8 minutes/month)
- **Burn Rate**: Rate at which error budget is consumed
