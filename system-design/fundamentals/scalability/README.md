# Scalability Patterns

## Quick Summary
- Horizontal scaling distributes load across multiple machines vs vertical scaling (adding power to existing machines)
- Load balancing distributes requests across servers using various algorithms (round-robin, weighted, least connections)
- Auto-scaling dynamically adjusts resources based on demand metrics and thresholds
- Database scaling uses sharding, replication, and partitioning strategies
- Rate limiting prevents system overload and ensures fair resource allocation

## Core Concepts

### Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling

**Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)**
- Add more power (CPU, RAM, storage) to existing machines
- Simpler to implement and manage
- Limited by hardware constraints and single point of failure
- Good for: databases, applications with shared state

**Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)**
- Add more machines to distribute load
- Better fault tolerance and virtually unlimited scaling potential
- More complex coordination and data consistency challenges
- Good for: stateless web servers, distributed systems, microservices

### Load Distribution Strategies

**Load Balancing Patterns**
- Round Robin: Sequential distribution across servers
- Weighted Round Robin: Distribution based on server capacity
- Least Connections: Route to server with fewest active connections
- IP Hash: Route based on client IP for session affinity
- Health-based: Avoid routing to unhealthy servers

**Service Discovery**
- Dynamic registration and discovery of service instances
- Health checking and automatic failover
- Load balancer configuration updates

### Auto-Scaling Mechanisms

**Reactive Scaling**
- Scale based on current metrics (CPU, memory, request count)
- Threshold-based triggers with cooldown periods
- Works well for predictable load patterns

**Predictive Scaling**
- Scale based on forecasted demand
- Machine learning models for capacity planning
- Better for applications with known usage patterns

**Schedule-based Scaling**
- Pre-planned scaling for known traffic patterns
- Time-based resource allocation
- Useful for business applications with regular cycles

## Implementation

See code examples for practical implementations:

- Redis-based coordination across instances

### Auto-Scaling
- Auto-scaling controller: `./code/auto-scaling.js`
- Metric-based scaling decisions
- Cloud provider integration patterns

### Database Scaling
- Sharding implementation: `./code/database-sharding.js`
- Consistent hashing for data distribution
- Replication and partitioning strategies

### Capacity Planning
- Interview calculator: `./code/interview-scaling-calculator.js`
- Back-of-envelope calculations for system design
- Performance modeling and bottleneck analysis

## Architecture Patterns

See scaling architecture diagrams: `./diagrams/scaling-patterns.txt`

### Microservices Scaling
- Independent scaling of individual services
- Service mesh for load balancing and discovery
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)

### Database Scaling Patterns
- Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Write scaling through sharding and partitioning
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Event sourcing for audit trails and replay capability

### Caching Layers
- Multi-level caching strategies
- CDN for global content distribution
- Application-level caching (Redis, Memcached)
- Database query result caching

## Common Pitfalls

### Scaling Challenges
- **Premature scaling**: Over-engineering before reaching actual bottlenecks
- **Single points of failure**: Load balancers, databases, shared services
- **Data consistency**: CAP theorem trade-offs in distributed systems
- **Session affinity**: Sticky sessions limiting load distribution
- **Cascading failures**: One service failure affecting entire system

### Database Scaling Issues
- **Hot spots**: Uneven data distribution in sharded systems
- **Cross-shard queries**: Complex joins across multiple database instances
- **Replication lag**: Eventual consistency challenges
- **Schema migrations**: Coordination across multiple database instances

### Load Balancer Problems
- **Health check configuration**: False positives/negatives in health detection
- **SSL termination**: Certificate management and performance overhead
- **Geographic distribution**: Latency optimization vs fault tolerance

## Interview Questions

### Scaling Strategy Questions

1. **"How would you scale a web application from 1K to 1M users?"**
   - Approach: Start with vertical scaling, move to horizontal scaling
   - Implementation: `./code/scaling-progression.js`
   - Key considerations: Database scaling, caching, CDN, microservices

2. **"Design a load balancer for high-traffic applications"**
   - Approach: Health checking, multiple algorithms, failover
   - Implementation: `./code/load-balancer.js`
   - Trade-offs: Performance vs complexity, stateful vs stateless

3. **"How would you handle database scaling for write-heavy workloads?"**
   - Approach: Sharding, write replication, event sourcing
   - Implementation: `./code/database-sharding.js`
   - Considerations: Consistency, partition tolerance, query complexity

### Capacity Planning Questions

4. **"Estimate the infrastructure needed for Twitter-scale system"**
   - Approach: Back-of-envelope calculations
   - Tool: `./code/interview-scaling-calculator.js`
   - Metrics: QPS, storage, bandwidth, cache sizing

5. **"How would you implement rate limiting for an API?"**
   - Approach: Token bucket, sliding window, distributed coordination
   - Implementation: `./code/rate-limiter.js`
   - Considerations: Fairness, burst handling, storage efficiency

## Performance Metrics

### Key Scalability Indicators
- **Throughput**: Requests per second, transactions per minute
- **Latency**: Response time percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
- **Resource utilization**: CPU, memory, disk I/O, network
- **Error rates**: Failed requests, timeout percentages
- **Availability**: Uptime, fault tolerance, recovery time

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Real-time dashboards for system health
- Automated scaling triggers based on metrics
- Capacity planning with historical trend analysis
- Performance regression detection

## Trade-offs

### Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
**Horizontal Scaling**
- ✅ Better fault tolerance, unlimited scaling potential
- ✅ Cost-effective with commodity hardware
- ❌ Complex coordination, data consistency challenges
- ❌ Network overhead, increased operational complexity

**Vertical Scaling**
- ✅ Simple implementation, strong consistency
- ✅ No network overhead, easier debugging
- ❌ Hardware limits, single point of failure
- ❌ Expensive high-end hardware, downtime for upgrades

### Load Balancing Algorithms
**Round Robin vs Least Connections**
- Round Robin: Simple, even distribution, good for similar server capacities
- Least Connections: Better for varying request processing times
- Weighted algorithms: Account for different server capabilities

### Database Scaling Approaches
**Replication vs Sharding**
- Replication: Read scaling, data redundancy, eventual consistency
- Sharding: Write scaling, horizontal partitioning, query complexity
